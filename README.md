Ultrasonic Radar System with HC-SR04 Sensor:

This project involves developing an ultrasonic radar system using an HC-SR04 sensor. The system is capable of delivering non-contact range detection with 
high accuracy and stable readings from 2 cm to 400 cm. A user-friendly GUI has also been implemented for determining object distance and angle.


Hardware Requirements:

The following components are required to build the ultrasonic radar system:

Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04
|| Servo motor
|| Arduino board
|| Breadboard
|| Jump wires


Software Used:

The Processing development environment is used for developing the user-friendly GUI.


Implementation:

The ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the objects, and a small hobbyist servo motor is used for rotating the sensor. The Arduino board is used to control 
the sensor and the servo motor. The system uses the ultrasonic sensor to determine the distance of the objects and the servo motor to scan the area for objects.

The system is programmed in the Arduino IDE, and the Processing development environment is used to develop the user-friendly GUI. The GUI displays the distance 
and angle of the detected objects.
